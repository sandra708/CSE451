 * exactly which threads are in the process, e.g. for debugging, add
 * an array and a sleeplock to protect it. (You can't use a spinlock
 * to protect an array because arrays need to be able to call
 * kmalloc.)
 *
 * You will most likely be adding stuff to this structure, so you may

 * However, note that p_addrspace must be protected by a spinlock:
 * thread_switch needs to be able to fetch the current address space
